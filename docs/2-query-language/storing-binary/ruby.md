RethinkDB supports a native binary object type, letting you use ReQL to store binary objects directly in the database. The ReQL driver will transparently translate between the ReQL type and the Ruby [String](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/String.html) class.

For these examples, we'll assume that the RethinkDB connection is available in global scope as `conn`.

# Storing uploaded files in the database

It's a common task for web applications to accept file uploads from users; with RethinkDB you can store these files directly in the database.

```rb
def save_file(file_path, save_name, user_id)
    # Store the file at 'file_path' with the filename 'save_name'.
    fh = File.open(file_path, 'rb')
    contents = fh.read()
    fh.close()
    r.table('files').insert({
        :user_id => user_id,
        :filename => save_name,
        :file => r.binary(contents)
    }).run(conn)
end
```
In `save_file`, we pass a path to the uploaded file (which may be in a temporary storage directory, even with a temporary name depending on the uploading library we've used), the name to save the file with, and the id of the user who's uploaded the file. The [binary](/api/ruby/binary) ReQL command is used to store the file's contents as a binary object in the `file` field.

```rb
def get_user_file_ids(user_id)
    # Retrieve the IDs of previously-saved files for a user as an array of
    # hashes: [ { :id => x, :filename => y }, ...]
    return r.table('files').filter({ :user_id => user_id }).
        pluck('id', 'filename').run(conn)

def get_file(file_id):
    """
    Retrieve a file by its ID. Returns a hash with 'filename' and 'file'
    keys.
    """
    return r.table('files').get(file_id).pluck('file', 'filename').run(conn)
```

Then, there are two functions for retrieving files: one to retrieve a directory of a user's uploaded files (`get_user_file_ids`) and one to retrieve the actual file itself (`get_file`). We don't have to use `binary` again here; the ReQL driver will return the proper data type for the `file` field in our object.

Here's another, more fun example: adding [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/) avatars to user accounts. We can use [http](/api/ruby/http) to retrieve them.

```rb
require 'digest'

def add_gravatar(user_id):
    """
    Add a gravatar field with the binary avatar icon to user accounts if they
    have an avatar associated with their email address.
    """
    email = r.table('users').get(user_id)['email'].run(conn)
    hash = Digest::MD5.hexdigest email
    gravatar_url = 'http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/' + hash + '?d=retro'
    r.table('users').get(user_id).update({
        'gravatar': r.http(gravatar_url, :result_format => 'binary')
    }).run(conn)
```

Where's `r.binary`? You don't need it in this case, because `r.http` will return a binary object with the `:result_format => 'binary'` option. (If the MIME type on the sending server is set correctly, you can even leave that off, and `r.http` will figure out the correct type.)
