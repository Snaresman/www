# Install binary packages #

RethinkDB is in the `community` repository. To install the server, run:

```bash
# pacman -S rethinkdb
```

See [the ArchWiki article on RethinkDB][awr] for more information.

# Install with the Arch Build System #

RethinkDB can be compiled automatically by the Arch Build System, the ports-like system for building and packaging software from source code in Arch Linux. Note that ABS may lag slightly behind the Arch binary repositories.

{% infobox %}

According to the `PKGBUILD` some tests may be "flaky" on Btrfs. If you use Btrfs and you are unable to build RethinkDB due to failed tests, you should not edit the `PKGBUILD` to skip the test suite; this might expose you to security problems in production. We suggest using binary packages, or editing the specific failing test.

## `yaourt` shortcut ##

If you have `yaourt` installed, simply run:

```bash
$ yaourt -Sb rethinkdb
```

This will automatically download the `PKGBUILD` script provided by ABS, download and extract the RethinkDB source, compile and test RethinkDB, create a `pacman`-compatible package, and install the package on the local system. Full customization is possible by editing the `PKGBUILD` when prompted.

## Semi-manual build ##

Ensure you have the `abs` package installed, `/etc/abs.conf` configured for the `community` repository (see [the ArchWiki article on ABS][abs]), and `/etc/makepkg.conf` configured to your liking (see [the ArchWiki article on makepkg][makepkg]).

[abs]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System#How_to_use_ABS
[makepkg]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg

Copy the `PKGBUILD` and related files to a working directory:

```bash
$ sudo abs community/rethinkdb
$ cp -r /var/abs/community/rethinkdb/ ~
```

Edit `PKGBUILD` to customize the build at this point.

Install thedependencies, build and install the package (the `-s` flag causes `makepkg` to attempt to 
install explicit build dependencies):

```bash
# pacman -S base-devel
$ cd ~/rethinkdb
$ makepkg -s
# pacman -U rethinkdb-1.15.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
```


# Build from official source #

## Install build dependencies  ##

You will need to install the `base-devel` group and several additional build dependencies:

```bash
# pacman -S base-devel protobuf boost python2 gperftools v8 nodejs
```

## Get the source code ##

Clone the RethinkDB repository:

```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 -b v{{site.version.major}}.x https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb.git
```

## Build RethinkDB ##

RethinkDB's `configure` script assumes the `python` executable will be Python 2 (i.e., `/usr/bin/python` is symlinked to `/usr/bin/python2`), which will break your build ('python 3.4.2 is too recent' etc.). Rather than rewriting this symlink and potentially breaking other software, consider installing the following script as `/usr/local/bin/python` (replace `/home/user/rethinkdb` with the absolute path of your own working directory):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
script=$(readlink -f -- "$1")
case "$script" in (/home/user/rethinkdb)
    exec python2 "$@"
    ;;
esac

exec python3 "$@"
```

This will redirect calls to `python` originating from your RethinkDB working directory to `python2` and leave others untouched. Ensure that the script is executable (`chmod +x`) and, if necessary, reload your shell before continuing.

To run the build:

```bash
$ cd ~/rethinkdb
$ ./configure --dynamic tcmalloc_minimal
$ make
```

Once successfully built, the `rethinkdb` binary may be found in the `build/release/` subdirectory.  

To install RethinkDB globally:

```bash
$ cd ~/rethinkdb
# make install
```
