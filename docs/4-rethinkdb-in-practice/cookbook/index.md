You can find three cookbooks for the three official drivers. The recipes comes from the most
frequently asked questions.

- [JavaScript](javascript/)
- [Python](python/)
- [Ruby](ruby/)

All of the cookbooks are pretty similar, but each may contain additional recipes specific to its language. 

__Looking for another language?__ 
So far, we've only created cookbooks for the three official RethinkDB drivers.
We'll eventually create ones for our community-supported drivers as well, but
if you'd like to help us move that process along, contact us at <a
