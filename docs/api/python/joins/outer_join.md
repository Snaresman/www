# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
sequence.outer_join(other_sequence, predicate) &rarr; stream
array.outer_join(other_sequence, predicate) &rarr; array
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Returns a left outer join of two sequences. The returned sequence represents a union of the left-hand sequence and the right-hand sequence: all documents in the left-hand sequence will be returned, each matched with a document in the right-hand sequence if one satisfies the predicate condition. In most cases, you will want to follow the join with [zip](/api/python/zip) to combine the left and right results.

Note that `outer_join` is slower and much less efficient than using [concat_map](/api/python/concat_map/) with [get_all](/api/python/get_all). You should avoid using `outer_join` in commands when possible.

__Example:__ Return a list of all Marvel heroes, paired with any DC heroes who could beat them in a fight.

```py
r.table('marvel').outer_join(r.table('dc'),
  lambda marvel_row, dc_row: marvel_row['strength'] < dc_row['strength']
).zip().run(conn)
```

(Compare this to an [inner_join](/api/python/inner_join) with the same inputs and predicate, which would return a list only of the matchups in which the DC hero has the higher strength.)
