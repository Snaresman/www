{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Tests whether two geometry objects intersect with one another. When applied to a sequence of geometry objects, `intersects` acts as a [filter](/api/ruby/filter), returning a sequence of objects from the sequence that intersect with the argument.


__Example:__ Is `point2` within a 2000-meter circle around `point1`?

```rb
> point1 = r.point(-117.220406,32.719464)
> point2 = r.point(-117.206201,32.725186)
> r.circle(point1, 2000).intersects(point2).run(conn)

true
```

__Example:__ Which of the locations in a list of parks intersect `circle1`?

```rb
circle1 = r.circle([-117.220406,32.719464], 10, {:unit => 'mi'})
r.table('parks')('area').intersects(circle1).run(conn)
```
