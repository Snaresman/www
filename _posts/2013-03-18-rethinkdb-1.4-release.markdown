RethinkDB 1.4 ([Some Like it Hot][yt]) is out.  This release includes an
improved wire protocol, updated drivers, support for query history in the data
explorer, and a brand-new build system. It contains well over 100 bug fixes,
features, and improvements (you can see the complete list of [closed issues on
Github][1]).

# The improved wire protocol and updated drivers

The [improved wire protocol][protocol] has been in the works for over two
months, and makes writing client drivers for new languages significantly
easier. RethinkDB supports Ruby, Python, and Javascript, and there are
[community contributed drivers][drivers] for Haskell, C, and Go. The new
protocol will make it even easier to add new languages&ndash;so far the most
requested include PHP, .NET and Java. If you're interested in helping, contact
[@mlucy][] or [@wmrowan][].

In the process of implementing the new protocol we've also rewritten the
official Python, Ruby and Node.js drivers. We used this opportunity to
incorporate the feedback we've received from our users.

Read more about the [many changes to ReQL][reql-changes] for the Ruby, Python,
and Javascript drivers for all the details.

# Data explorer: query history and suggestion improvements

The easiest way to talk about the new features of the data explorer is a
screenshot:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-03-18-data-explorer.png" />

Starting with this version, the data explorer maintains a history of the
queries run. Past queries can be re-run with just two clicks, and the history
is saved in the browser storage (and is persistent across sessions). 

The code completion popup got a couple of improvements as well: API parameters
are showed at the top, database and table names are more readable, and the
suggester [doesn't pop up in unexpected places][#320].  Oh, and you no longer
need to type `.run()` at the end of your queries.

# Building from source and Homebrew builds

While we continue to work on providing more binary distributions, for some
users building from source remains the only solution for installing RethinkDB
on their platform. Many people pointed out that the RethinkDB build system had
a lot to be desired, so [@atnnn][] rewrote it from scratch.  Take a look at the
improved [build instructions][] and give the build system a try!

The Mac OS X got a binary distribution with the [previous release][1.3], but
we've also worked on [improving the Homebrew formula][#235].

[#235]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/235

There are many other improvements that we would like to brag about, but we
think that [downloading the new version][install] would provide more useful and
pleasant details about RethinkDB 1.4.
