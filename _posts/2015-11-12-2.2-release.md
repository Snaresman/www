Today, we're pleased to announce RethinkDB 2.2 ([Modern
Times][release-poster]). [Download it now][download]!

RethinkDB 2.2 includes over [120 enhancements][release-notes], significantly
improves performance, memory usage and scalability, adds new ReQL commands, and
ships with atomic changefeed support. Some of the major improvements in the 2.2
release include:

* __Atomic changefeeds:__ the `changes` command now accepts an optional
  argument called `includeInitial`, which allows atomically reading existing
  data and processing new results with a [single query][gh-3579].
* __Optimized fetches:__ the `getAll` code path has been
  [optimized][gh-1526] to perform a single network round trip, which
  results in an 8x performance improvement.
* __Parallel scans:__ fetching large amounts of sequential data from
  RethinkDB now [scales linearly][gh-4343] with the size of the cluster.
* __Improved memory usage:__ memory usage on large datasets has been
  [reduced][gh-1951] by over 50%.
* __New ReQL commands:__ We added a new `values` command, and [Peter
  Hollows][@captainpete] expanded `r.uuid` to support [user defined
  hashes][gh-4636].

# Atomic changefeeds

One of the most common patterns when building realtime web or mobile
applications is to render the page and then update it any time there is new
information. For example, if you're presenting your users with a leaderboard,
you'd typically want to render the leaderboard right away, and then update it
when it changes.

Prior to RethinkDB 2.2 you could accomplish it by running two separate
queries: one to fetch initial data, and another to listen to changes.

```js
// Get the initial data for top ten players
var leaderboard = r.table('gameplays')
                   .filter(r.row.gt(1000))
                   .run(conn);
// Open a changefeeed to receive updates
var changes = r.table('gameplays')
               .filter(r.row.gt(1000))
               .changes()
               .run(conn);
```

There are two problems with this approach. First, you have to write two
different pieces of code: one to handle the initial data, and one to handle
the changes. While this doesn't present any insurmountable challenges, having
to write code twice to process every piece of realtime data quickly becomes a
significant burden in applications that heavily rely on realtime functionality.

The second problem is more serious -- the code above contains a race condition.
There is a small gap between the time you get the initial results and the time
you subscribe to a feed, and new data might slip in between the two queries.
When that happens, you end up missing the change, and your users are left with
inconsistent information.

## Changefeeds can use `includeInitial`

RethinkDB 2.2 fixes both problems by introducing an `includeInitial` option to
the `changes` command. When `includeInitial` is set to `true`, existing data is
automatically injected into the changefeed:

```javascript
// Open a changefeed to receive updates, including initial data
var changes = r.table('gameplays')
               .filter(r.row.gt(1000))
               .changes({ includeInitial: true })
               .run(conn);
```

The example above will give you all the players with a score greater than 1000.
After it gives you the initial list, it will give you a stream of updates as the
players scores change.

The availability of initial changefeed results simplifies realtime application
development for many RethinkDB users, but it's especially worth noting that
this feature brings us one big step closer to accommodating the requirements of
the popular Meteor framework, and paves the way for a robust [Meteor
integration][gh-4629].

## Compatibility

In previous versions of RethinkDB, changefeeds automatically included initial
results for some queries (those using `orderBy.limit` or `get`) but not others,
and there was no way to control this behavior. In RethinkDB 2.2, changefeeds
only emit their initial results by default if you explicitly set
`includeInitial` to `true`, and the option is now available on all changefeeds.

__Note:__ this is a breaking change. Please update your applications to explicitly
turn on `includeInitial` when you need it.

# Performance improvements

In addition to atomic changefeeds, the 2.2 release brings significant
performance, scalability, and memory efficiency improvements.

## Faster secondary indexes

You can expect to see [major performance gains][gh-4862] for `between`
operations that rely on secondary indexes. In our internal benchmarks, a query
that uses an index to count a million items went from 1.3 seconds in RethinkDB
2.1.0 to 0.5 seconds in 2.2.

## Faster streaming in Python

We also worked to deliver better performance in cases where users stream large
data sets with the Python client driver. An operation that involves reading 1
million documents that are roughly 200 bytes each went from 20 seconds in
version 2.1.0 to 9.1 seconds in version 2.2.

Community member Adam Grandquist [contributed code][gh-4825] that
extends the Python client driver so that users can plug in third-party JSON
parsing libraries like RapidJSON for faster document decoding. When we added
RapidJSON to our benchmark configuration, the completion time of the million
document benchmarked dropped even further, down to 6.7 seconds.

## Parallel scans

The performance of fetching a large number of documents is [improved even
further][gh-4343] if you're running a RethinkDB cluster. Table scans
across multiple RethinkDB servers are now done in parallel, and you can
expect linear scalability on table scans as of RethinkDB 2.2.

## Faster `getAll` queries

The performance of the `getAll` command has also been significantly improved
since releasing RethinkDB 2.1 three months ago.  If you're using `getAll` with
multiple keys, you can expect performance improvements of up to 8x on common
workloads.

## Lower memory usage on large datasets

We've also significantly [reduced the memory][gh-1951] overhead incurred when
working with large datasets that are too big to fit in memory.  The memory
overhead in these cases has been reduced by over 50%. New tables will
automatically benefit from this improvement.

## Improved index construction

RethinkDB 2.2 dramatically [reduces the performance impact][gh-4959] of
creating a new secondary index. We've redesigned the index construction process
to run at background priority, and to use less memory while running on a
production system. Additionally, you can now restart your servers in the middle
of an index construction and it will resume where it left off.

# New ReQL commands

While most of the work in the 2.2 release was focused on atomic changefeeds and
performance improvements on high-scale workloads, we've also added new ReQL
commands that should make using RethinkDB more convenient.

In RethinkDB 2.2 we added a new `values` command that mirrors the existing
`keys` command and allows getting field values from an object:

```js
// Returns `[1, 2]`
r.expr({ a: 1, b: 2}).values()
```

[Peter Hollows][@captainpete] expanded the `r.uuid` command to support
[name-based UUIDs][gh-4636] using SHA1. You can now call `r.uuid(name)` in
ReQL to get a name-based UUID.

We've also added a way for clients to [determine][gh-3934] which RethinkDB
server they're connected to. You can call `conn.server` to get the server
information on a connection.

# Now on Slack

We’re also really excited about the [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/rethinkdb/shared_invite/enQtNzAxOTUzNTk1NzMzLWY5ZTA0OTNmMWJiOWFmOGVhNTUxZjQzODQyZjIzNjgzZjdjZDFjNDg1NDY3MjFhYmNhOTY1MDVkNDgzMWZiZWM/)
for the RethinkDB dev community. We launched the group a month ago as an
experiment, and it's growing quickly and has become an indispensable part of
the community.

We’d love for you to join the Slack group, but if that's not your cup of tea
don't worry -- the development team is still on [#rethinkdb on IRC][freenode].
