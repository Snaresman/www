We're co-hosting a RethinkDB + Firebase meetup on realtime sync architectures
for web and mobile apps. We'll be talking about:

- designing backend realtime sync architectures
- scaling those architectures when it's time
- new features in RethinkDB and Firebase to make building realtime apps easier

Come hang out with the RethinkDB and Firebase teams -- or even better, give a
lightning talk on how you're using RethinkDB!
<!--more-->

We're meeting at Firebase's office in SF (_22 4th Street, Suite 1000, 10th
floor_) on __Tuesday, July 1st at 6pm__. Space is limited, so make sure to RSVP
on our [meetup page][].
