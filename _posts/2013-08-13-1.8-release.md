We are happy to announce __RethinkDB 1.8__ (<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MooNISe8aM" class="hidden">High
Noon</a>). [Download it now!](/docs/install/)

This release includes the following features and improvements:

* ReQL improvements
  - **Dates and times** are natively supported, and there are over 20
    new commands for creating, manipulating, and querying them.
  - **Nested documents** are easier to work with in `update` and `merge`.  (We
    also extended support for `pluck`'s nested document syntax to `without`,
    `group_by`, `with_fields`, and `has_fields`.)
* Server improvements
  - Server uses **8x less disk space**.
  - Tables support **efficient ordering** by primary or secondary indexes.
  - **Javascript evaluation** is more efficient and reliable.
  - **Cross-network cluster operation** is much easier.

See the [full list](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v1.8.0) of
[over 90](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=40&state=closed)
bug fixes, features, and enhancements.

Michael Lucy ([@mlucy](https://github.com/mlucy)), an engineer at RethinkDB,
introduces these new features in this two-minute video:

# Dates and times #

Users have been asking for native date-time support since the very first public
versions of RethinkDB.  It's been a long time coming, but we're pretty proud of
what we've put together.

You can insert native time objects in whatever language you're using:

```ruby
r.table('events').insert({'id' => 0, 'time' => Time.now}).run(conn)
```

You can then ask timezone-aware questions about them, like "what hour did this
occur in the event's time zone?"  Since this is written in pure ReQL,
even complicated operations involving times can be distributed
efficiently over the cluster, or used as the function for a secondary index.

```ruby
> r.table('events').get(0)['time'].hours().run(conn)
16

> r.table('events').filter{|row| row['time'].hours().eq(16)}.run(conn).to_a
[{"time"=>2013-08-14 16:27:19 -0700, "id"=>0}]
```

Note that the time was converted back to a native time object in the client:

```ruby
> x = r.table('events').get(0).run(conn)
{"time"=>2013-08-14 16:27:19 -0700, "id"=>0}

> x['time'].class
Time
```

There's a lot more you can do &mdash; and, despite our best efforts, there are
also a [few gotchas](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/6168031) that inevitably
crop up around dates and times.  Head over to the [dates and times
documentation](/docs/dates-and-times) to see more cool features, or to learn
about the nitty-gritty problems like precision, leap seconds, and language
support for time zones.

# Nested documents #

We've heard over and over again from users that `update` is a pleasure
to use, until you need to modify a nested document, at which point
doing anything useful becomes a herculean task. As of 1.8, `update`
now has full support for nested documents. Let's say you have a table
`nested_users` that looks like this:

```ruby
> r.table('nested_users').run(conn).to_a
[{"id"=>0, "data"=>{"name"=>"Alice", "age"=>18}}]
```

The new `update` and `merge` commands recurse down into sub-objects,
so that if you want to update Alice's age in `nested_users`, you can
now write:

```ruby
NEW> r.table('nested_users').get(0).update({'data' => {'age' => 19}}).run(conn)
{"unchanged"=>0, "skipped"=>0, "replaced"=>1, "inserted"=>0, "errors"=>0, "deleted"=>0}

NEW> r.table('nested_users').run(conn).to_a
[{"id"=>0, "data"=>{"name"=>"Alice", "age"=>19}}]
```
<div class="infobox infobox-info">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If your existing application uses <code>update</code> and <code>merge</code> and expects it
    to be shallow, this may be a breaking change for your application.</p>
</div>

If you want the old behavior, we've introduced a new term `r.literal` which
means "I want literally this object, not the result of merging the old object
with this one.":

```ruby
NEW> r.table('nested_users').get(0).update(
       {'data' => r.literal({'age' => 19})}).run(conn)
{"unchanged"=>0, "skipped"=>0, "replaced"=>1, "inserted"=>0, "errors"=>0, "deleted"=>0}

NEW> r.table('nested_users').run(conn).to_a
[{"id"=>0, "data"=>{"age"=>19}}]
```

# 8x disk space utilization improvement #

Prior to this release the RethinkDB disk serializer supported a fixed
block size. This resulted in the following space utilization behavior:

* Small documents (<= 250 bytes) were packed tightly in the B-Tree and
  did not waste disk space.
* Larger documents (> 250 bytes) were aligned to 4KB blocks, wasting
  as much as 800% of disk space in common use cases.

As of the 1.8 release the serializer now supports variable-sized block
sizes, and the large value code takes full advantage of this
functionality. If you're using large documents, you should see up to
8x disk space utilization improvement on many insert workloads.

# Looking forward to the 1.9 release #

Now that the 1.8 release is out, the team is focused entirely on
getting RethinkDB to a production-ready version. 1.8 is the last
release to include major new features prior to the production-ready release
(RethinkDB 2.0). We're now hard at work on the
[1.9 release](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=46&page=1&state=open),
which will mostly contain performance and scalability improvements,
stability fixes, and architectural improvements in preparation for
production readiness.

Look out for a blog post about the road to RethinkDB 2.0 in the next
few days. In the meantime, if you have comments about the roadmap,
we'd love to [hear from you](http://rethinkdb.com/community/)!
