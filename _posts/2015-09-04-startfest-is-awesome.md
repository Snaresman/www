Not only are the mountains of Utah great and the people the friendliest, Provo has some things going for it when it comes to technology.

I just got back to RethinkDB HQ in Mountain View from attending [StartFEST 2015][startfest] hosted by [BeehiveStartups][beehive] over in Provo, UT. RethinkDB was kindly offered an opportunity to do a small workshop in the dev track of the festival, always eager to get out in the world, I was whisked away to Utah.

I think that a lot of startup-focused-festivals or conferences suffer from one or both of two things. The first being what I call "Conf Fatigue" which is just that draining feeling one can get after being around hundreds of people in a crowded space day after day. The other, I call "Lack of Vibe", which a lot of conferences that are saturated with marketers experience. This is where anyone coming up to talk to you could be trying to sell you something, which creates a blanket of implicit social distrust amongst attendees.

Not surprisingly, the second annual StartFEST had neither of the two. All the venues are on Center Street in downtown Provo and it was amazing to walk outside and see the [Wasatch Range][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range] wrap the skyline. Bumping into other attendees on the sidewalk always resulted in a great conversation. And, sitting down to eat was a lot of fun as everyone was willing to share what they were working on and it was a very collaborative atmosphere. I heard all about 401k plans for millenials, [carbon fiber guitars][klos], and [supporting content creators online for just pennies][https://pennypledge.co/welcome/].

When it came time for my workshop, I had a great interactive session with people familiar and not familiar with RethinkDB. Even for those who had head of us, I got to demonstrate some of our new failover features from our [2.1 release][2_1] which is always really fun to show using the RethinkDB web interface.

Overall, while I only in Utah for a short 48 hours this time, we at RethinkDB always look forward to coming back to the Beehive State. 

Also congrats to [Purpose Portfolio][purpose_portfolio] for winning runner-up and to [SimpleCitizen][simplecitizen] for winning both People's Choice and the grand prize!
