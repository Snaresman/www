Not only are the mountains of Utah great, and the people the friendliest, Provo has some things going for it when it comes to technology.

Last week I got back to RethinkDB HQ in Mountain View from attending [StartFEST 2015][startfest] hosted by [BeehiveStartups][beehive] over in Provo, UT. RethinkDB was kindly offered an opportunity to do a small workshop in the dev track of the festival, and being always eager to get out in the world, I packed my bags for Utah.

I think that a lot of startup-focused-festivals or conferences suffer from one or both of two things. The first being what I call "Conf-Fatigue" which is just that draining feeling one can get after being around hundreds of people in a crowded space day after day. The other, I name loosely as "Lack of Vibe", where there's not a shared kind of spirit or trust between attendees. There's a blanket of implicit social distrust amongst attendees, where not everyone is on the same page on why they are there.

Not surprisingly, the second annual StartFEST had neither of the two. All the venues are on Center Street in downtown Provo and it was amazing to walk outside and see the [Wasatch Range][wasatch] wrap the skyline. Bumping into other attendees on the sidewalk always resulted in a great and friendly conversation. And, sitting down to eat was a lot of fun as everyone was willing to share what they were working on and it felt like a very collaborative atmosphere. I heard about 401k plans for millenials, [carbon fiber guitars][klos], and [supporting content creators online for just pennies][pennypledge].

When it came time for my workshop, I had a great interactive session with people familiar and not familiar with RethinkDB. I demonstrated our great WebGUI and our changefeeds but even for those who had heard of us, I got to show some of RethinkDB's new failover features from our [2.1 release][2_1]. I personally enjoyed giving people a crash course in sharding and replication.

Overall, while I only in Utah for a short 48 hours this time, we at RethinkDB always look forward to coming back to the Beehive State.

Also congrats to [Purpose Portfolio][purpose_portfolio] for winning runner-up and to [SimpleCitizen][simplecitizen] for winning both People's Choice and the grand prize! These are both really exciting projects that bridge the gap between social innovation and technology.
