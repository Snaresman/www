Join us tomorrow (Friday, January 30th) for a live webcast at 1:30PM PT. Daniel
Mewes, RethinkDB's director of engineering, and systems engineer Tim Maxwell
will introduce some of the new features included in our upcoming 1.16 release.

The webcast will offer a first look at RethinkDB's new comprehensive cluster
management API, which makes it easy to configure sharding and replication with
ReQL expressions. You'll also get a hands-on introduction to RethinkDB's
[realtime push functionality][1],
demonstrating how RethinkDB can dramatically simplify the development of
realtime web apps. The webcast will conclude with a live Q&A segment, where
you'll have a chance to query the RethinkDB team in realtime.
