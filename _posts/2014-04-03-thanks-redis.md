Yesterday, Salvatore [posted an amazing write-up](http://antirez.com/news/75)
on implementing the really neat HyperLogLog data structure in Redis. We keep
being amazed by Redis and Salvatore &mdash; he's taught us a great deal about
good APIs, usability, and software development in general. We learned so much
from Redis, we drew this to celebrate his work. Thanks for your hard work,
[@antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)!
