title: "RethinkDB raises an $8M Series A"

Today we're delighted to announce our Series A! We've raised $8M to fund
development, grow the RethinkDB community, and ultimately make database tools
[feel indistinguishable from magic][magic].

[magic]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1000

Here's what we're planning to accomplish with this new development budget:

- __Get to a long-term support release__: Since we first shipped the beta
  version of RethinkDB we've been humbled by the feedback, support, and
  encouragement from our users. Over the past thirteen months we've shipped ten
  new releases, fixed hundreds of bugs, and added dozens of new features. We're
  now hard at work polishing the final rough edges in preparation for the
  upcoming LTS release.

- __Grow the community:__ An amazing community has sprung up around RethinkDB
  over the past year. We're incredibly grateful to all the people who've spent
  time developing and supporting client drivers for [15 different
  languages][install-drivers], building frameworks, ORMs, and designing new
  admin tools. We're now in a position to give back to our community by
  sponsoring conferences, promoting community projects, improving
  documentation, and introducing more developers to RethinkDB.

- __Offer commercial support:__ Thousands of developers are already building
  applications backed by RethinkDB; from mobile games to gene sequence
  analysis, and everything in between. In the coming months we'll be adding
  commercial support options to give these teams everything they need to
  confidently use RethinkDB in production deployments.)

We're also excited to welcome [Peter Bell][pb] from Highland Capital Partners
to our board. Peter has a deep background in infrastructure technology and led
the investment, joined by [Josh Stein][js] from DFJ, and the amazing team at
[Webb Investment Network][win] (Maynard Webb's early stage investment fund)
&mdash; all incredibly supportive early seed investors in RethinkDB. We're
excited to continue working with them to build a long-term open-source
technology company.
