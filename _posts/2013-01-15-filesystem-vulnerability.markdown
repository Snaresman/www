title: Filesystem vulnerability identified, please update to RethinkDB 1.3.2
---

We identified a filesystem vulnerability this morning that allows read access
to arbitrary files on the filesystem through the web administation tool.

A fix has been pushed for all platforms in RethinkDB 1.3.2, so __please update
immediately__: see the [install page][] for instructions.

[install page]: /docs/install

# What caused this vulnerability?

The built-in web server has a whitelist to allow serving only a very specific
set of files required to run the web administration tool (see the [whitelist][]
on Github).

[whitelist]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/next/src/clustering/administration/http/server.cc

However, we inadvertently disabled the whitelist during development. One of our
engineers noticed this during a procedural code review (a policy recently
introduced after the release of RethinkDB 1.2) and we implemented [a fix][]
immediately.

# What we're doing to prevent this in the future

As of RethinkDB 1.2, no code goes into the master branch without code reviews
and sign-offs from engineers.

This has two effects:

- We're significantly less likely to introduce similar vulnerabilities under
  peer review.
- We discover existing issues more readily (as was the case here).

# Next steps

Until RethinkDB is production-ready, we will continue to advise users to ensure
that RethinkDB runs behind a firewall and on a secured network.

As RethinkDB nears production-ready state, we're focused on eliminating these
issues. If you encounter potential vulnerabilities, please email us immediately
at [info@rethinkdb.com][], or notify us that you've discovered a potential
issue via any of our [public channels][] and we'll follow up with you
immediately.
