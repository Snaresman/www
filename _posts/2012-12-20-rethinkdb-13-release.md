We've released RethinkDB 1.3 <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSExdX0tds4"
class="hidden">(Metropolis</a>) which has a large number of enhancements, and
adds support for OS X and several other platforms. As of the 1.3 release, the
server can now be installed on the following platforms:

* OS X Lion and above (>= 10.7)
* 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu Lucid and above (>= 10.04)

Porting to OS X was one of the most requested features, and allows OS
X users to try RethinkDB without installing a Linux VM. The story of
long and arduous adventure of overcoming the many differences between
the Darwin and Linux kernels and their surrounding environments
remains to be told by [@srh](https://github.com/srh).

The 1.3 release involved closing [sixty-nine
issues](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?labels=&milestone=4&page=1&state=closed)
over five weeks, including twenty-five bug fixes, ten enhancements,
and thirty-four general improvements. A number of community projects
based on RethinkDB have started in the past month, so we're kicking
off a [community projects
wiki](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/Community-contributions)
with various contributions from community members including C,
Haskell, and Go client drivers, example code, and portability recipes.

more cool stuff!
