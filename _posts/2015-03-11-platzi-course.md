Join us Saturday, March 14 for a live RethinkDB training course. The two-hour
workshop, taught by RethinkDB evangelist Segphault and hosted online by our
friends at Platzi, will teach you how to build realtime web applications with
RethinkDB. The course is available for free&mdash;all you have to do is sign
up.

The course includes:

* An introduction to RethinkDB and distributed databases
* A hands-on overview of ReQL, the RethinkDB query language
* A guided intro to building realtime apps with RethinkDB and Node.js
* An introduction to RethinkDB clustering and scalability best practices

Attend live to ask questions and participate interactively. If you can't make
it for the live session, you will be able to watch the recorded video later.
