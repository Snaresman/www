title: Why start a new database company in 2010?
--- 
We were honored to give a closing keynote talk at [MySQL Conference & Expo
2010][1], and wanted to share the video with you. Why start a new database
company? What is RethinkDB all about? What will database technology look like
twenty years from now? In this talk we explore these questions, present some of
the exciting technology we've been developing at RethinkDB, and show how it
fits into our larger vision of what database systems may look like in the
future.
