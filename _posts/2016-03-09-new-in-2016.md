At a recent meetup in San Francisco, our CEO Slava Akhmechet introduced
some of the new features coming in 2016. His presentation included an early
look at Horizon, an upcoming framework that extends RethinkDB to the browser
and makes it possible for developers to build realtime web applications without
writing backend code. You can watch a
[complete video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL5_EsF06DM) of the
talk, embedded below:

Slava began his presentation with an overview of major new features and
capabilities that the RethinkDB team released in 2015. The noteworthy
highlights included the production-ready 2.0 release, high-availability
clustering on top of the Raft consensus protocol, and support for asynchronous
queries in the Ruby and Python client drivers.

He also discussed how RethinkDB's growing focus on realtime updates is
attracting new users and shaping the evolution of the database. Starting
[at 10:24](https://youtu.be/zL5_EsF06DM?t=10m24s), he shared the rationale behind
Horizon (sometimes called by its previous codename, Fusion) and described how
it will improve realtime application development for RethinkDB users:

> [Horizon] is a layer on top of RethinkDB that will give people a complete
> backend where they can build their apps. The server exposes a
> WebSocket protocol that browsers can connect to directly. You can just build
> your frontend using the [Horizon] API and you don't have to worry about doing
> any of the backend stuff.

Starting [at 16:00](https://youtu.be/zL5_EsF06DM?t=16m), you can watch the
live-coding segment of Slava's talk, in which he provides a hands-on look at
the Horizon framework. During the demo, he uses the JavaScript console in
Chrome to connect to a Horizon server and perform queries. He also used
[two browser windows side-by-side](https://youtu.be/zL5_EsF06DM?t=20m5s) to show how
an individual client can subscribe to receive live updates from the server.

[At 23:53](https://youtu.be/zL5_EsF06DM?t=23m53s), Slava discussed the scope of
the Horizon project and some of the advanced features that it will eventually
offer out of the box.

> Part of the idea behind [Horizon] is that it will include all kinds of basic
> services that you will need as a web developer--like sessions, persistence,
> geolocation stuff, authentication, security, all these things. As
> you start building your app you can get up to speed very quickly. As things get
> more progressively complicated, there's an upgrade path.

Finally, starting [at 24:30](https://youtu.be/zL5_EsF06DM?t=24m30s), Slava
discussed how developers will deploy their Horizon applications. Users can
choose to self-host, but RethinkDB will also offer a Horizon Cloud service
for managed deployments in the user's own cloud infrastructure.

> Because everything is open source, you can just deploy it yourself. But
> if you are actually doing this at scale, doing this deployment is kind of a
> pain because there are a lot of challenges," he said. "The idea behind
> [Horizon] Ops is that its a cloud service that will let people get their app
> online and scale it up or down--and everything will be managed.
