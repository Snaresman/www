We are pleased to announce that our friends at
[Compose][] now offer RethinkDB hosting in the cloud.
Their new service lets you get a managed RethinkDB deployment in a matter of
seconds, providing a fast and easy way to start working on your RethinkDB
project without the overhead of managing your own infrastructure or
provisioning your own cluster.

[Compose]: https://www.compose.io/

Compose, formerly known as MongoHQ, is a dedicated Database as a Service
(DBaaS) company. RethinkDB is the third database in their product lineup,
launching alongside their existing support for MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
Available today as a public beta, their hosted RethinkDB deployments come with
automatic scaling and backups.

Each deployment provided by Compose is configured as a high-availability
cluster with full redundancy. Their elastic provisioning service manages the
entire environment, scaling deployments as needed to accommodate user
workloads. Pricing starts at $45 per month for a three-node cluster with 2GB of
storage capacity.

# Migrate data from a MongoDB deployment

In addition to elastic scaling, Compose also offers a data migration system
called a Transporter. If you have data in an existing MongoDB deployment
managed by Compose, you can seamlessly import it into a RethinkDB deployment.

The import can be a one-time event or maintained on an ongoing basis with
continuous updates&mdash;regularly pulling the latest changes into RethinkDB
from your MongoDB deployment. If you have an existing MongoDB application that
you would like to consider migrating to RethinkDB, Compose makes it really easy
to get started.

# Get started with Compose

To create a hosted RethinkDB instance, click the Add Deployment button in the
Compose admin panel and select RethinkDB. Simply enter a name for the
deployment&mdash;Compose handles the rest. You will need to input billing
information for your Compose account if you have not done so previously.

Each RethinkDB deployment hosted by Compose has its own private network.
Compose uses SSH tunneling to provide secure access to a hosted cluster. When
you create a RethinkDB deployment in the Compose admin console, it will give
you the host and port information that you need to connect.

Once you set up the SSH tunnel on your client system, you can work with the
hosted RethinkDB instance in much the same way you would work with a local
installation of the database. Even the RethinkDB admin console and Data
Explorer operate as expected.

Building your next application with RethinkDB couldn't be easier. [Register an
