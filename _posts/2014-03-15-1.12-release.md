Today, we're happy to announce __RethinkDB 1.12__ (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQLNS3HWfCM" class="hidden">The Wizard of Oz</a>). [Download it now!](/docs/install/)

With over
[200 enhancements](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=53&state=closed),
the 1.12 release is one of the biggest releases to date. This release includes:

- Dramatically simplified map/reduce and aggregation commands.
- Big improvements to caching that do away with long-standing stability and performance limitations.
- A port to the ARM architecture.
- Four new ReQL commands for object and string manipulation.
- Dozens of bug fixes, stability enhancements, and performance improvements.

    <strong>Upgrading to 1.12?</strong> Make sure to
    <strong><a href="/docs/migration">migrate your data</a></strong>
    before upgrading to RethinkDB 1.12. &rarr;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Please note a breaking change:</strong> the 1.12 release
    replaces the commands <code>group_by</code> and
    <code>grouped_map_reduce</code> with a single new command
    <code>group</code>. You will have to adapt your applications to
    this change when you upgrade. See the
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/9518214">1.12 migration guide</a>
    for details.

# Simplified map/reduce and aggregation #

Let's say you have a table `plays` where you keep track of gameplay
outcomes for users of your game:

```javascript
[{ play_id: 1, player: 'coffeemug', score: 100 },
 { play_id: 2, player: 'mlucy', score: 1000 },
 { play_id: 3, player: 'mlucy', score: 1200 },
 { play_id: 4, player: 'coffeemug', score: 200 }]
```

In RethinkDB, you could always count the number of games in the table
by running a `count` command:

```python
> r.table('plays').count().run(conn)
4
```

The built-in `count` command is a shortcut for a map/reduce query:

```python
> r.table('plays').map(lambda x: 1).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y).run(conn)
4
```

The new release removes the old `group_by` and `grouped_map_reduce`
commands, and replaces them with a single, much more powerful new
command called `group`. This command breaks up a sequence of documents
into groups. Any commands chained after `group` are called on each
group individually, rather than all the documents in the sequence.

Let's say we want to count the number of games for each player:

```python
> r.table('plays').group('player').count().run(conn)
{ 'mlucy': 2, 'coffeemug': 2 }
```

Of course instead of using the shortcut, you could write out the full
map/reduce query with the `group` command:

```python
> r.table('plays').group('player').map(lambda x: 1).reduce(lambda x, y: x + y).run(conn)
{ 'mlucy': 2, 'coffeemug': 2 }
```

In addition to the already available aggregators like `count`, `sum`,
and `avg`, the 1.12 release adds new aggregators `min` and `max`. You
can now run all five aggregators on any sequence of documents or on
groups, resulting in a unified, powerful API for data aggregation.

Chaining after `group` isn't limited to built-in aggregators. We can
chain any command, or series of commands after the `group`
command. For example, let's try to get a random sample of two games
from each player:

```python
> r.table('plays').group('player').sample(2).run(conn)
```

These examples only scratch the surface of what's possible with
`group`. Read more about the [group command](/api/python/#group) and
the new [map/reduce infrastructure](/docs/map-reduce/).

# Big improvements to caching #

1.12 includes a lot of improvements to the caching infrastructure. The
biggest user-facing change is that you no longer have to manually
specify cache sizes for tables to prevent running over memory and into
swap. Instead RethinkDB will adjust cache sizes for you on the fly,
based on usage statistics for different tables and the amount of
memory available on your system.

We've also made a lot of changes under the hood to help with various
stability problems users have been reporting. Strenuous workloads and
exotic cluster configurations are much less likely to cause stability
problems in 1.12.


# A port to ARM #

Four months ago David Thomas
([@davidthomas426](https://github.com/davidthomas426) on GitHub)
contributed a
[pull request](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/pull/1625) with
the changes necessary to compile and run RethinkDB on ARM. After
months of testing and various additional fixes, the ARM port has been
merged into RethinkDB mainline.

You shouldn't have to do anything special. Just run `./configure` and
`make` as you normally would:

```bash
$ ./configure --allow-fetch
$ make
```

Note that ARM support is experimental, and there are still some issues
(such as [#239](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/239)) to work
out.

Special thanks to David for the port, and to the many folks who did
the testing that made the merge possible!

# Object and string manipulation commands #

The 1.12 release includes new commands for string manipulation and
object creation.

Firstly, ReQL now includes commands for changing the case of strings:

```python
> r.expr('Hello World').downcase().run(conn)
'hello world'

> r.expr('Hello World').upcase().run(conn)
'HELLO WORLD'
```

We also added a `split` command for breaking up strings, which behaves
similarly to the native Python `split`:

```python
> r.expr('Hello World').split().run(conn)
['Hello', 'World']

> r.expr('Hello, World').split(',').run(conn)
['Hello', ' World']
```

Finally, the 1.12 release includes an `object` command that allows
programmatically creating JSON objects from key-value pairs:

```python
> r.object('a', 1, 'b', 2).run(conn)
{ 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
```

You can learn more about the commands in the
[API documentation](/api).

# Performance and stability improvements #

In addition to stability work by almost everyone on the RethinkDB
team, for the past four months
[@danielmewes](https://github.com/danielmewes) dedicated his time
almost entirely to stability and performance improvements. He
uncovered and fixed dozens of latency and memory problems, stability
issues with long running clusters, and slowdowns during highly
concurrent workloads.

Here is a very small sample of the stability fixes that ship with the 1.12 release:

* The RethinkDB web server now [supports compression](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1746)
added by [@Tryneus](https://github.com/Tryneus) to improve the admin UI experience on slow connections.
* [@neumino](https://github.com/neumino) added [automated performance regression tests](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1806) that act as an additional harness.
* [@danielmewes](https://github.com/danielmewes) made a number of [improvements](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1043) to parallel data processing code.
