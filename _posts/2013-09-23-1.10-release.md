We are happy to announce __RethinkDB 1.10__ (<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JPu3BP5Ets"
class="hidden">Von Ryan's Express</a>). [Download it now!](/docs/install/)

This release lets you index a row by multiple values at once, which
can make entire classes of queries much faster (see below).  It also
includes major improvements to the way we serialize small values,
which should increase the performance of many disk/network-bound
workloads.

Take a look at the
[full list](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
of improvements, or watch Daniel Mewes
([@danielmewes](https://github.com/danielmewes)), an engineer at RethinkDB,
talk about the 1.10 release in this two-minute video:

# Multi-indexes #

Prior to RethinkDB 1.10, there was no way to index a single document
by multiple values.  This made certain workloads incurably slow.  For
example, if you had a table of GitHub issues with a field `tags`:

```python
{
  ...,
  "tags": ["feature", "ReQL", "secondary_indexes"],
  ...
}
```

There was no fast way to retrieve all the github issues with the tag
`feature`.  Now, you can create a multi-index to do exactly that:

```python
r.table('github_issues').index_create('tags', multi=True).run(conn)
r.table('github_isses').get_all('feature', index='tags')
```

Want to start using multi-indexes right away?  Head to our
[API page](/api/#js:manipulating_tables-index_create).

# Serialization improvements #

We've made several improvements to the way we serialize values,
especially small values.  For example, RethinkDB stores all numbers as
doubles internally, and previously we would serialize a full double to
disk every time we wrote a number.  Now, in the (common) case where
documents contain small integers, we use a variable-length integer
encoding instead.  After lots of small improvements in this vein
(which you can find in the
[release notes](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/releases/tag/v1.10.0)),
we're seeing up to 30% improvements in the serialized size of
previously problematic JSON documents.

# Getting to an LTS release #

We're still hard at work on our first LTS release, due (hopefully)
near the end of the year.  In pursuit of that, our next few releases
will continue to focus on performance and stability.

As previously mentioned, here is how the LTS release will be different from the
beta releases we've been shipping until now:

* It will go through a longer QA process that will include rigorous
  automated and manual testing
* All known high impact bugs and performance issues will be solved
* We'll publish results of our tests on high demand, large scale
  workloads in a clustered environment
* The LTS release will have an additional margin of safety since it
  will first be battle tested by our pilot customers
* We will be offering commercial support, training, and consulting
  options

If you have feedback or questions about this process, we'd love to
[hear from you](/community/)!
