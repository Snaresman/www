We're teaming up with [AirPair][] to support their $100k developer writing
competition. We've sponsored a $500 cash prize to honor the best RethinkDB post
submitted to the contest.

[AirPair]: https://www.airpair.com/

AirPair, which provides a service that connects developers with experts for
live programming sessions, recently introduced an experimental set of [social
authoring features][1] that make it possible for authors and readers to
collaborate on content. AirPair's social authoring platform uses a GitHub-based
workflow that involves forking and pull requests. They launched a [writing
competition][] to highlight the experiment and encourage developers to give it
a try.

Over the next twelve weeks, you can win your share of $100,000 in prize money
for producing the best tutorials, opinion pieces, and hands-on reports about
your experiences using RethinkDB in production.

Have you built a project that involved RethinkDB? Do you have a compelling
revelation to share about how RethinkDB can simplify realtime application
architecture? If so, consider writing an article for AirPair to share your
experience with other RethinkDB developers.

An article published on AirPair will reach a wide audience of developers. The
average post published on the site in January received over 15,000
views&mdash;it's a great way to shine a spotlight on your work.
