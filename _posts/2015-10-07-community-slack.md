We're really excited to share our [new Slack group](http://slack.rethinkdb.com) for the RethinkDB dev community!

We use Slack internally here at RethinkDB and it has been a valuable tool to keep us connected with other team members, companies, and users. Apprehensive to add another tool to your repertoire? Donâ€™t fret! We're still active on IRC ([#rethinkdb](irc://chat.freenode.net/#rethinkdb) on Freenode).

We plan on hosting office hours with the community team and engineers, but this is also a great way to connect with other RethinkDB users in your local community and all over the world.
