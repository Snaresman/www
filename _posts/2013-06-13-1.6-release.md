## Regex string matching ##

RethinkDB 1.6 introduces __regular expressions__ into the query language (ReQL).
We've integrated Google's [re2](https://code.google.com/p/re2/) library into
the server and introduced a new [r.match](/api/#js:string_manipulation-match) command. 

The `match` command returns the matched string, the starting and ending
location, and capture groups in a json object. It returns `null` if there is no
match. 

You can use it to match regular expressions in strings as follows:

```javascript
r.expr('My name is Slava').match('name is (.*)')
// returns {"str":"name is Slava","start":3,"groups":[{"str":"Slava","start":11,"end":16}],"end":16} 
```

Here's an example of using regular expressions to find every user whose first
name begins with the letter S:

```javascript
r.table('users').filter(r.row('first_name').match('S.*'))
// returns all JSON documents where `first_name` begins with `S`:
```

You can even use `match` in a secondary index for efficient access:

```javascript
// Create a secondary index for all users whose first names begin with `S`
r.table('users').indexCreate('starts_with_S', r.row('first_name').match('S.*').ne(null))

// Efficiently get all the users where `first_name` begins with `S`
r.table('users').getAll(true, {index: 'starts_with_S'})
```

## New array operations ##

Over the past few months we've discovered that many of our users are using
arrays in ways we didn't anticipate -- as sets, or as containers for deeply
nested elements. In the 1.6 release we've added __fourteen new array operations__
to make these use cases easier:

* [prepend](/api/#js:document_manipulation-prepend): prepends an element to an array
* [append](/api/#js:document_manipulation-append): appends an element to an array
* [insertAt](/api/#js:document_manipulation-insert_at): inserts an element at the specified index
* [spliceAt](/api/#js:document_manipulation-splice_at): splices a list into another list at the specified index
* [deleteAt](/api/#js:document_manipulation-delete_at): deletes the element at the specified index
* [changeAt](/api/#js:document_manipulation-change_at): changes the element at the specified index to the specified value
* [add](/api/#js:math_and_logic-add): adds two arrays -- returns the ordered union
* [mul](/api/#js:math_and_logic-mul): repeats an array _n_ times
* [difference](/api/#js:document_manipulation-difference): removes all instances of specified elements from an array
* [count](/api/#js:aggregation-count): returns the number of elements in an array
* [indexesOf](/api/#js:transformations-indexes_of): returns positions of elements that match the specified value in an array
* [isEmpty](/api/#js:transformations-is_empty): check if an array or table is empty
* [setInsert](/api/#js:document_manipulation-set_insert): adds an element to a set    
* [setUnion](/api/#js:document_manipulation-set_union): returns the union of two sets
* [setDifference](/api/#js:document_manipulation-set_difference): returns the difference of two sets
* [setIntersection](/api/#js:document_manipulation-set_intersection): finds the intersection of two sets

These new commands should make working with arrays in RethinkDB delightful. 

## Random sampling ##

Many people use RethinkDB for analytics and data crunching, and [have been
asking](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/182) us to add support
for __random sampling__. We've now added a new
[r.sample](/api/#js:transformations-sample) command that returns a random
sample of a table:

```javascript
// Get a random sample of five users
r.table('users').sample(5)
```

You can also use the `sample` command on arrays:

```javascript
// Get three random elements from the array
r.expr([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).sample(3)
```

## Error handling improvements ##

When we initially designed the error handling system in RethinkDB, we made a
design decision: errors should be as strict as possible. Prior to the 1.6
release, filtering documents by non-existent attributes would throw an error.

The following command:

```javascript
r.expr([{name: 'Slava', age: 30}, {name: 'Mickey'}]).filter(r.row('age').gt(20))
```

would return this error:

```
RqlRuntimeError: No attribute `age` in object:
{ "Mickey" } in:
r([{name: "Slava", age: 30}, {name: "Mickey"}]).filter(function(var_5) { return r.row("age").gt(30); })
                                                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

In order to avoid this issue, users had to explicitly check for
existence of the attributes as part of the query. We found that everyone
 unilaterally disliked this behavior.

In RethinkDB 1.6, rows that have missing attributes will automatically be
skipped by operations like `pluck` and `filter`:

```javascript
r.expr([{name: 'Slava', age: 30}, {name: 'Mickey'}]).filter(r.row('age').gt(30))

// now returns [{name: 'Slava', age: 30}]
```

If you need strict error handling in `filter`, you can enable the old behavior:

```javascript
r.expr([{name: 'Slava', age: 30}, {name: 'Mickey'}]).filter(r.row('age').gt(30),
                                                            {default: r.error()})
// throws the `No attribute age` error.
```

## Basic authentication support ##

This version also introduces __basic authentication__ via shared keys. Many of
our users run RethinkDB in public clouds and environments like EC2; while it's
easy enough to secure RethinkDB with a reverse proxy and Amazon security
groups, we had a lot of demand for basic shared-key authentication.

Based on feedback from the community and recommendations by the folks at
[MongoHQ](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/266#issuecomment-18759677)
-- who have tremendous operational experience with running databases -- we
chose to start with a simple model, similar to that of
[Redis](http://redis.io/topics/security).

You can now set a simple authentication key, and the cluster will reject any
client driver that doesn't provide the key. Set the key as follows:

```
$ rethinkdb admin -j host:port
> set auth foobar
```

Once the authentication key is set, you have to provide it to the
client drivers in order to connect to the server:

```javascript
r.connect({host: host, post: port, authKey: 'foobar'}, ...)
```

You can unset the key as follows:

```
$ rethinkdb admin -j host:port
> unset auth
```

## Looking forward to 1.7 ##

Our team is now working on the
[1.7 release](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=35&page=1&state=open). This
release will include improved support for handling nested attributes
(see issues [#872](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/872)
and [#889](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/889)),
performance improvements (see
[#897](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/897) and
[#939](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/939)), and improved
data import/export tools (see
[#193](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/193)).

We'd love to hear what you think about the roadmap --
[let us know](http://rethinkdb.com/community/)!
