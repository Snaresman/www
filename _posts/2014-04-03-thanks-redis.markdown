Yesterday, Salvatore [posted an amazing write-up][1] on implementing
the really neat HyperLogLog data structure in Redis. We keep being
amazed by Redis and Salvatore &mdash; he's taught us a great deal
about good APIs, usability, and software development in general. We
learned so much from Redis, we drew this to celebrate his work.
Thanks for your hard work, [@antirez][]!
