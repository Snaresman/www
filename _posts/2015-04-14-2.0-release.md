We're proud to announce that after five years of development,
RethinkDB is ready for production. [Download](/install) RethinkDB
2.0 (Yojimbo) now!

TODO: VIDEO GOES HERE

We designed RethinkDB from the ground up to make building and
scaling realtime apps dramatically easier. The cumulative
development effort behind the project includes more than [2,000
improvements](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed),
implemented across 16 major releases. Our GitHub repository has
nearly 30,000 commits, spanning the lifetime of the project.

RethinkDB 2.0 inverts the traditional database model. Instead of
polling for changes, the developer can tell RethinkDB to
continuously push live query updates to the
application. Propagating updates from the persistence layer
simplifies realtime application architecture by eliminating the
need for external message queues and other extraneous
plumbing. You can also take advantage of RethinkDB's distributed
architecture to effortlessly scale your realtime app.

RethinkDB is used in production today by hundreds of technology
startups, consulting studios, and Fortune 500 companies. Here are some
example use cases:

- [Jive Software][] and [Mediafly][] use RethinkDB to power reactive web and mobile apps
- [Pristine.io][] and [Narrative Clip][] use RethinkDB to power cloud infrastructure for connected devices
- [Platzi][] and [Workshape.io][] use RethinkDB to power realtime analytics
- [CMUNE][] and [NodeCraft][] use RethinkDB to power massively scalable multiplayer games
