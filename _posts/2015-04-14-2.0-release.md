We designed RethinkDB from the ground up to make building and
scaling realtime apps dramatically easier. The cumulative
development effort behind the project includes more than [2,000
improvements](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed),
implemented across 16 major releases. Our GitHub repository has
nearly 30,000 commits, spanning the lifetime of the project.

RethinkDB 2.0 inverts the traditional database model. Instead of
polling for changes, the developer can tell RethinkDB to
continuously push live query updates to the
application. Propagating updates from the persistence layer
simplifies realtime application architecture by eliminating the
need for external message queues and other extraneous
plumbing. You can also take advantage of RethinkDB's distributed
architecture to effortlessly scale your realtime app.
