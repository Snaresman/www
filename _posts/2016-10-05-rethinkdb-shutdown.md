Today I have sad news to share. After more than seven years of development, the company behind RethinkDB is shutting down. We worked very hard to make RethinkDB successful, but in spite of all our efforts we were unable to build a sustainable business. There is a lot of information to unpack -- over the next few months, I'll write about lessons learned so the startup community can benefit from our mistakes.

I just installed RethinkDB 2.3.5 on a new laptop and took a few minutes to slow down and play with the product. I'm very proud of what we built alongside our community -- RethinkDB's technology more often feels like magic, and I hope it will continue to play an important role in advancing the state of the art in database technology.

A few of us from the RethinkDB community are developing a continuity plan for [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) and [Horizon](https://horizon.io). Both projects will continue to be available, distributed under open source licenses. We hope to continue our open development process with a larger community of contributors.

We'd like your help to ensure RethinkDB’s future as an open-source project. If you're willing to contribute, please join us in the #open-rethinkdb channel of our [public Slack group](https://slack.rethinkdb.com). You can expect to see development slow down in the meantime, but everything will continue to be available on [rethinkdb.com]() and [horizon.io](). We will post updates on our blog and Twitter as we continue working things out.

With the company shutting down, we also wanted to find a new home for our team. We looked at a number of options, and were deeply impressed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) -- in particular, their [commitment to open-source](https://stripe.com/open-source), supporting users, and improving developer tools. We’re excited that the members of our engineering team will be joining Stripe, where we can put our expertise to work solving new problems and building tools for developers around the world.  

Thank you for standing with us over the years.
