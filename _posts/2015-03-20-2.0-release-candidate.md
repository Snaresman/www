The RethinkDB 2.0 release candidate is [now available for testing][1].
RethinkDB 2.0 is designed to make building and scaling realtime apps
dramatically easier. The upcoming 2.0 launch is an important milestone, marking
our very first production-ready release. We'll announce commercial support
options and other services alongside the release.

After five years of development, RethinkDB is ready for widespread adoption
with the upcoming 2.0 release.  The cumulative development effort behind the
project includes more than [2,000 improvements][], implemented across 16 major
releases. Our most recent release, [RethinkDB 1.16][], dramatically expanded
the `changes` command and introduced [powerful support for building realtime
web applications][realtime-web].

In addition to performance and stability improvements, the 2.0 release
candidate also includes some noteworthy new features that complement the
realtime functionality we introduced in the 1.16 release:

* Support for attaching a changefeed to the [`get_all`][] command.
* Support for attaching a changefeed to the [`union`][] command.
* Optional EventMachine integration for performing asynchronous queries in the
  Ruby driver.
* Optional Tornado integration for performing asynchronous queries in the
  Python driver.
* A new feature in the cursor API that supports [consuming the next element in
  a stream without blocking][non-blocking].

[`get_all`]: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#get_all
[`union`]: http://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#union
[non-blocking]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/664

The EventMachine and Tornado integrations haven't landed in the client drivers
yet, though the necessary backend features are already present. We'll issue new
release candidate client drivers with full support for those features in the
coming days.

This release candidate is intended for testing and evaluation purposes. We're
eager to get feedback from users to help guide our efforts as we put the
finishing touches on version 2.0. This is also a great opportunity for users to
start exploring RethinkDB ahead of our big launch.

A [growing number][2] of users [already deploy][3] RethinkDB in production. We
look forward to seeing the user community grow further in the coming months as
our first production-ready release brings RethinkDB to a broader audience.
