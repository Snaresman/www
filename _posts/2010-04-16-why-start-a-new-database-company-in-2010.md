We were honored to give a closing keynote talk at [MySQL Conference & Expo
2010](http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/), and wanted to share the video with
you. Why start a new database company? What is RethinkDB all about? What will
database technology look like twenty years from now? In this talk we explore
these questions, present some of the exciting technology we've been developing
at RethinkDB, and show how it fits into our larger vision of what database
systems may look like in the future.
