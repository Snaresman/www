RethinkDB 1.4 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo2v3kTxzBU"
class="hidden">(Some Like it Hot</a>) is out.  This release includes an
improved wire protocol, updated drivers, support for query history in the data
explorer, and a brand-new build system. It contains well over 100 bug fixes,
features, and improvements (you can see the complete list of [closed issues on
Github](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=5&page=1&state=closed)).

## The improved wire protocol and updated drivers ##

The [improved wire
protocol](http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-wire-protocol-call-for-comments/)
has been in the works for over two months, and makes writing client drivers for
new languages significantly easier. RethinkDB supports Ruby, Python, and Javascript, and there are [community
contributed drivers](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/Community-contributions)
for Haskell, C, and Go. The new protocol will make it even easier to
add new languages&ndash;so far the most requested include PHP, .NET and Java. If you're
interested in helping, contact [@mlucy](https://github.com/mlucy) or [@wmrowan](https://github.com/wmrowan).

In the process of implementing the new protocol we've also rewritten the
official Python, Ruby and Node.js drivers. We used this opportunity
to incorporate the feedback we've received from our users.

Read more about the [many changes to
ReQL](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/wiki/ReQL-changes-in-RethinkDB-1.4)
for the Ruby, Python, and Javascript drivers for all the details.

## Data explorer: query history and suggestion improvements ##

The easiest way to talk about the new features of the data explorer is a
screenshot:

Starting with this version, the data explorer maintains a history of the queries
run. Past queries can be re-run with just two clicks, and the history is saved in
the browser storage (and is persistent across sessions). 

The code completion popup got a couple of improvements as well: API parameters
are showed at the top, database and table names are more readable, and the
suggester [doesn't pop up in unexpected places](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/320). 
Oh, and you no longer need to type `.run()` at the end of your queries.

## Building from source and Homebrew builds ##

While we continue to work on providing more binary distributions, for some
users building from source remains the only solution for installing RethinkDB
on their platform. Many people pointed out that the RethinkDB build system had a lot 
to be desired, so [@atnnn](https://github.com/atnnn) rewrote it from scratch.
Take a look at the improved [build instructions](/docs/build/) and give the
build system a try!

The Mac OS X got a binary distribution with the [previous
release](http://www.rethinkdb.com/blog/rethinkdb-13-release/), but we've also
worked on [improving the Homebrew
formula](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/235). 

There are many other improvements that we would like to brag about, but we
think that [downloading the new version](/docs/install) would provide more useful and pleasant
details about RethinkDB 1.4.
