Today we've updated the [documentation page](/docs) with a set of
simple example apps that use RethinkDB as the backend database. These
examples should serve as a quick way to figure out how to use
stack __X__ with RethinkDB. While very basic, the examples
give a good idea of how to put all the pieces together.

So far we've published two applications based on the following stacks:

* A [todo list](/docs/examples/flask-backbone-todo) built with Flask, Backbone.js, and RethinkDB (see it on [GitHub](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-example-flask-backbone-todo))
* A [simple Pastie app](/docs/examples/sinatra-pastie) built with Sinatra and RethinkDB (see it on [GitHub](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-example-sinatra-pastie))

The code is available on GitHub under the MIT license. We really like
the documentation format generated by
[rocco.rb](http://rtomayko.github.com/rocco/), so we used it to annotate the source code. Documenting these apps has been a good exercise in eating our own dog food because we had to put the API to work and identify new ways
to improve it.

If you have a favorite stack that you'd like to see [let us
know](/community). Of course you can also write an example app
yourself, and we'll make sure to include it in the list.
