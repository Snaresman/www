title: RethinkDB example apps

Today we've updated the [documentation page][docs] with a set of simple example
apps that use RethinkDB as the backend database. These examples should serve as
a quick way to figure out how to use stack X with RethinkDB. While very basic,
the examples give a good idea of how to put all the pieces together.

[docs]: /docs

So far we've published two applications based on the following stacks:

* A todo list built with Flask, Backbone.js, and RethinkDB (see it on
  [GitHub][todo-github])
* A simple Pastie app built with Sinatra and RethinkDB (see it on
  [GitHub][pastie-github])

[todo]: /docs/examples/flask-backbone-todo
[todo-github]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-example-flask-backbone-todo
[pastie]: /docs/examples/sinatra-pastie
[pastie-github]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb-example-sinatra-pastie

The code is available on GitHub under the MIT license. We really like the
documentation format generated by [rocco.rb][], so we used it to annotate the
source code. Documenting these apps has been a good exercise in eating our own
dog food because we had to put the API to work and identify new ways to improve
it.

If you have a favorite stack that you'd like to see [let us know][contact]. Of course
you can also write an example app yourself, and we'll make sure to include it
in the list.
