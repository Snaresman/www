We've put together a short screencast to showcase some of the features of
RethinkDB. The screencast walks through starting RethinkDB, inserting and
updating JSON documents through the web UI using the Javascript ReQL driver,
building data analysis queries (to get insight into GitHub's commit information
dataset), as well as sharding and replicating data. Check it out!
