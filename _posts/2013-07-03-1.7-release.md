## Import and export ##

Two extremely common use cases among RethinkDB users are to import
existing JSON and CSV datasets into the database, or to export
RethinkDB data as JSON or CSV to be used by another system. While it's
pretty simple to write quick import and export scripts using ReQL
drivers, we didn't want new users to keep replicating this work, so we
included standardized import and export tools into RethinkDB 1.7.

You can import and export data as follows:

```bash
# Import a JSON document into table `users` in database `my_db`
$ rethinkdb import -c HOST:PORT                          \ # database host and port
                   -f user_data.json                     \ # file to import
				   --table my_db.users                     # table to import the data into

# Export a table into a CSV file
$ rethinkdb export -c HOST:PORT                          \ # database host and port
                   -e my_db.users                        \ # only export the `users` table in database `my_db`
				   --format csv                          \ # export into CSV format
                   --fields first_name,last_name,address   # `--fields` is mandatory when exporting into CSV
```

* See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5894257) for more information on how to use `import` and `export` commands.
* Run `rethinkdb import --help` and `rethinkdb export --help` for full documentation.

## Hot backup and restore ##

RethinkDB 1.7 also ships with `dump` and `restore` commands that allow
easily doing hot backups on a live cluster. Back up your data as
follows:

```bash
# Dump the data from a RethinkDB cluster (placed in a file
# rethinkdb_dump_DATE_TIME.tar.gz by default)
$ rethinkdb dump -c HOST:PORT
```

Since the backup process is using client drivers, it automatically
takes advantage of the MVCC functionality built into RethinkDB. It
will use some cluster resources, but will not lock out any of the
clients, so you can safely run it on a live cluster.

You can reimport the data back into a running cluster as follows:

```bash
# Reimport an earlier dump
$ rethinkdb restore -c HOST:PORT rethinkdb_dump_DATE_TIME.tar.gz
```

The dump and restore commands are built on top of import and export,
and operate on `tar.gz` archives of JSON documents (along with
additional table metadata). You can run `rethinkdb dump --help` and
`rethinkdb restore --help` for more information.

## Atomic set and get ##

ReQL was always designed to support arbitrary atomic modification
operations of documents. For example, you could increment a counter as
follows:

```javascript
r.table('videos').get(id).update({ views: r.row('views').add(1) })
```

However, until the 1.7 release it wasn't possible to atomically get
back the result. We've now introduced an optional `return_vals`
argument for single-row modification operations. If you set it to
true, you'll atomically get back the old and new versions of the
document from the server:

```javascript
r.table('videos').get(id).update({ views: r.row('views').add(1) }, {return_vals: true })
// returns { replaced: 1,
//           vals: [{old_val: {..., views: N, ...},
//                   new_val: {..., views: M, ...}}]}
```

This functionality is similar to MongoDB's
[findAndModify](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/findAndModify/)
and Redis's atomic commands, and allows gracefully handling a variety
of sophisticated use cases.

* See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5894410) to learn how to use the atomic set-and-get functionality to implement a simple publish-subscribe queueing system.

## 10x insert performance improvement ##

Prior to this release, many people pointed out that RethinkDB has poor
insert performance. We did a lot of investigation and were able to
include fixes in this release that result in greater than 10x insert
performance improvement. There were multiple causes of poor
performance on data insertion:

1. We switched Python, Ruby, and Javascript clients to use significantly faster protocol buffer libraries that have C++ backends (see issues [#1025](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1025), [#1026](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1026), and [#1027](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1027) for more details).
2. Even with faster protocol buffer libraries, protocol buffer serialization is slower than JSON serialization. The `insert` command now automatically uses `r.json` whenever possible (see issue [#887](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/887) for more details).
3. The RethinkDB storage engine issued a flush command to operating systems more often than necessary for safety. This is now fixed (see issue [#520](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/520))).

The benchmark was done as follows:

* Machine spec
  * Processor: Intel Core i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz x 8
  * Memory: 11.7 GiB
  * Kernel: 3.2.0-49 64bit
  * OCZ Vertex 120GB SSD
* Benchmark configuration:
  * 10,000 documents
  * Inserting batches of 10 documents at a time
  * Default server settings (hard durability, `noreply` turned off)

Here are the results of performance tests for small (120 byte) documents:

<div class="perf_graph">
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-03-1.7-release-small_doc_perf.png"></img>
</div>

And here are the results of performance tests for large (8 KB) documents on the same machine:

<div class="perf_graph">
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2013-07-03-1.7-release-large_doc_perf.png"></img>
</div>

__Note__: these aren't scientific benchmarks, it's just something we put
together to demonstrate improvements. You should be able to experience the
improvements on most insert workloads in RethinkDB 1.7. We're working on
thorough and scientific benchmarks, and will be publishing them soon.

## Other enhancements ##

In addition to the changes above, we made a number of other
enhancements that make some ReQL use cases a lot more pleasant:

* The `getField` command now works on sequences (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5894435) for details).
* The `getAll` command now allows querying multiple keys (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5894442) for details).
* The `pluck` command now has syntax for manipulating nested objects (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/5894446) for details).

## Looking forward to 1.8 ##

We're starting to work on the
[1.8 release](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=40&page=1&state=open). It's
scheduled to include extensive improvements to nested attributes
handling (see issues
[#872](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/872) and
[#1094](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/1094)), native
support for date operations (see
[#977](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/977)), and
improvements to the `groupBy` and `groupedMapReduce` commands (see
[#977](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/977)).

After the 1.8 release is out, we expect to focus our efforts almost
entirely on performance and scalability as we gear up for a
production-ready release of RethinkDB. If you have comments about the
roadmap, we'd love to
[hear from you](http://rethinkdb.com/community/)!
