We are pleased to announce __RethinkDB 1.5__ (<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRBNA27N0ts"
class="hidden">The Graduate</a>), so go
[download it now](/docs/install/)!

This release includes the long-awaited support for secondary indexes,
a new algorithm for batched inserts that results in an ~18x performance
improvement, support for soft durability (don't worry -- off by
default), and [over 180](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=8&page=1&state=closed)
bug fixes, features, and enhancements.

## Secondary indexes ##

Support for secondary indexes has been the most requested feature
since we launched RethinkDB, and has been in development for over
[six months](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/88). It
required a massive amount of server work and involved modifying almost
every part of the codebase: the BTree code, the concurrency
subsystem, the distribution layer, the query language, the
client drivers, and even the web UI.

We worked hard to make sure secondary indexes are extremely easy to use. Here's
how you'd create a secondary index on the `last_name` attribute:

```javascript
r.table('users').indexCreate('last_name')
```

Then getting all users with the last name Smith would be:

```javascript
r.table('users').getAll('Smith', { index: 'last_name' })
```

Or you could retrieve arbitrary ranges of the index. For example, all users
whose last names are between Smith and Wade:

```javascript
r.table('users').between('Smith', 'Wade', { index: 'last_name' })
```

Listing and dropping indexes is also [a part of the API](/api/#js:manipulating_tables-index_list):

```javascript
r.table('users').indexList()             // list indexes on table 'users'
r.table('users').indexDrop('last_name')  // drop index 'last_name' on table 'users'
```

In addition to manipulating secondary indexes via ReQL, you can perform these
from the admin UI:

<a class="video-image" href="/videos/secondary-indexes-in-1-5"><img src="/assets/images/videos/rethinkdb-1.5.png" /></a>

You can define compound indexes, and even indexes based on arbitrary ReQL
expressions. Secondary indexes can be used to do efficient table joins, and are
sharded and replicated along with the rest of the database. Learn more about
[how to use secondary
indexes](/docs/secondary-indexes) in
the documentation.

## Batched inserts performance improvements ##

Since the initial release, RethinkDB has supported inserting batches
of documents. Instead of inserting multiple documents one at a time:

```javascript
r.table('users').insert({ name: 'Michael' })
r.table('users').insert({ name: 'Bill' })
```

it was always possible to insert a batch of documents in one command with a single network roundtrip:

```javascript
r.table('users').insert([{ name: 'Michael' },
                         { name: 'Bill' }])
```

However, the server had always executed batched inserts by translating
them to a series of single insert commands. While sending the data in
a single network roundtrip reduced the network latency, it still had
very poor performance because the server would have to flush each
document to disk before moving on to the next document.

The 1.5 release includes a [new insert algorithm](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/457)
that flushes changes to disk in batches while maintaining the guarantee of 
consistency in case of power failure. This algorithm drastically
improves performance of batched inserts. While not something we'd call a benchmark, inserting 100 medium-sized
documents went from 2.8 seconds to 160 milliseconds on a development
system, and the ~18x performance improvement is consistently
reproducible on different batched insert workloads and types of
hardware.

## Soft durability mode ##

Early in the development of RethinkDB, we made the design decision to
be extremely conservative about durability and safety of users's
data. In this respect RethinkDB is like any other traditional database
system -- the server does not acknowledge the write until it's safely
committed to disk. While this is a sensible default for a database
system, many of our users pointed out that they're using RethinkDB for
storing access logs or clickstream data, or as a persistent, replicated
cache of JSON documents. These scenarios might require trading off some durability guarantees for higher performance.

The 1.5 release includes support for relaxed durability (off by default, of
course). For tables in this mode, the server acknowledges writes as soon as it
receives them, and flushes data to disk in the background. Flushes normally
occur every few seconds, or if there are too many dirty blocks cached in
memory.

Hard durability can be turned off when creating a table via the
advanced settings in the web UI or in ReQL:

```javascript
db.tableCreate('http_logs', { hard_durability: false })
```

You'll notice that write performance on tables with hard
durability turned off is about ~30x faster than normal tables. Note that
the data still gets flushed to disk in the background and is
consistent in case of failures. For those familiar with MySQL's InnoDB
engine, RethinkDB's soft durability is similar to setting InnoDB's
`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to `0` ([more info on this setting in InnoDB]
(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit)).

You can change the durability mode for an existing table via the admin CLI:

```
$ rethinkdb admin -j localhost:29015
localhost:29015> set durability http_logs --hard
```

## Many more enhancements ##

The 1.5 release includes many more enhancements -- check out the
[changelog](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/blob/v1.5.0/NOTES) for a complete list. Here are a few more
notable changes:

* For super-fast insert performance, RethinkDB now supports
  [noreply writes](/api/#js:accessing_rql-run) that allow writing data over the
  network without waiting for a server acknowledgment. This mode
  allows for an apples-to-apples benchmark comparison with MongoDB.
* The Data Explorer in the web UI now supports
  [electric punctuation](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/569),
  as well as a toggle to turn it off. This can make typing queries in
  the data explorer much more pleasant.
* The web UI will now check if there is a new version of RethinkDB
  and inform you if you need to upgrade (the check is done as a simple AJAX
  request from the browser, and can be turned off).

## Looking forward to 1.6 ##

We are already hard at work on the
[1.6 release](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues?milestone=31&state=open). This
release should be quick and easy, and will include
[many](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/570)
[ReQL](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/341)
[enhancements](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/186). We will also focus on continuously improving performance with each version. However, the next
release isn't set in stone. If a feature is important to you,
[let us know](/community/).
