# Why is this agreement necessary?

We very much appreciate your wanting to contribute to RethinkDB, but we need to
add you to the contributors list first. Note that the following agreement is
_not_ a transfer of copyright ownership, this simply is a license agreement for
contributions. You also do _not_ change your rights to use your own
contributions for any other purpose.For some background on why contributor
license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source
projects:

  - Django's excellent [CLA FAQ][0]
  - A [well-written chapter][1] from Karl Fogel's _Producing Open Source Software_ on CLAs
  - The [Wikipedia article][2] on CLAs

This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some
red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind
the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more
permissive license in the future.If you have more questions, shoot us an
[email][3] or drop by [#rethinkdb][4] on IRC.
