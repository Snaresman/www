# Open Governance Model

## Foreword

The intention behind the Open Governance Model is to make it clear and understandable
for new contributors and even existing ones how to help the project and influence its future.
Based on this document, the community can choose who they trust to handle RethinkDB’s funding,
and corporate sponsors can make sure how their contributions are being handled.

It must be highlighted that the community will never be micromanaged by neither corporate
supporters or anyone from the project management committee.

## Overview

Anyone with an interest in RethinkDB can join the community, contribute to RethinkDB design
and participate in the decision-making process. This document describes how that participation
takes place and how to set about earning merit within the RethinkDB community.

## Roles and responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for RethinkDB. They are the most important
members of the community and without them, RethinkDB would have no purpose. Anyone can
be a user; there are no special requirements.

RethinkDB asks its users to participate in RethinkDB and community as much as possible.
User contributions enable RethinkDB team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs
of those users. Common user contributions include (but are not limited to):

* evangelizing about RethinkDB (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
* informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
* providing moral support
* providing financial support
* requesting new features

Users who continue to engage with RethinkDB and its community will often become more and
more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming Contributors, as described in the
next section.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to RethinkDB. Anyone can
become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms, as detailed in a separate
document. There is no expectation of commitment to RethinkDB, no specific skill requirements,
and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or
more of the following:

* supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users)
* reporting bugs
* identifying requirements
* providing graphics and web design
* programming assisting with project infrastructure
* writing documentation
* fixing bugs
* adding features

Contributors engage with RethinkDB through the issue tracker, and writing or editing documentation.
They submit changes to RethinkDB itself via patches. The developer Slack channel is the most
appropriate place to ask for help when making that first contribution.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with RethinkDB, their profile within,
and commitment to the community will increase.

### Project Management Committee

RethinkDB management committee consists of those individuals identified as ‘project owners’ on
the development and community side. The PMC has additional responsibilities over and above those
of a contributor. These responsibilities ensure the smooth running of RethinkDB. PMC members are
expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the
governance model and manage the copyrights within RethinkDB outputs.

Members of the PMC do not have significant authority over other members of the community. It also
makes decisions when community consensus cannot be reached. In addition, the PMC has access to RethinkDB’s
private mailing list, Slack channels, and its archives. This communication platform is used for sensitive
issues, such as legal matters, vulnerability reports and some strategic planning that cannot be discussed
in public.

Membership of the PMC is by invitation from the existing PMC members. A nomination will result in
discussion and then a vote by the existing PMC members. PMC membership votes are subject to consensus
approval of the current PMC members.

### PMC Chair

The PMC Chair is a single individual, voted for by the PMC members. Once someone has been appointed Chair,
they remain in that role until they choose to retire, or the PMC casts a simple majority vote to remove them.

The PMC Chair has no additional authority over other members of the PMC: the role is one of coordinator and
facilitator. The Chair is also expected to ensure that all governance processes are adhered to and has the
casting vote when RethinkDB fails to reach a simple majority.

## Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the RethinkDB management
infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognize that all
support activity within RethinkDB is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows.

## Decision-making process

Decisions about the future of RethinkDB are made through discussion with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced PMC member. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the RethinkDB GitHub repository, contributors’ mailing list or Slack channel. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private list or Slack channel.

In order to ensure that RethinkDB is not bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, RethinkDB operates a policy of lazy consensus.

This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

### Lazy consensus

Decision making typically involves the following steps:

* Proposal
* Discussion
* Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)
* Decision

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send a message to the RethinkDB contributors’ list, Slack channel or submit a patch implementing the idea to the issue tracker.
This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for
the contribution. Since most people in the RethinkDB community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order
to reach consensus.

In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is recognized as having the support of the community. This is
called lazy consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have implicitly agreed to the implementation of the
proposal.
The lazy consensus is a very important concept within RethinkDB. It is this process that allows a large group of people to efficiently
reach consensus, as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position, and others need not spend time
reading such mails.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours (3 days) before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal. This time period
is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.

### Voting

Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of
RethinkDB must gain explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions
in all discussions and all votes.
